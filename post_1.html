  For a while, in my professional work, I have been developing software applications using <em>Angular</em>. In a few
  cases I have faced questions about how one or other thing could have happened and I have not found a quick and
  unambiguous answer for myself. In this post I will discuss two interesting things of this nature:
</div>
<ol>
  <li>How dynamically, from <em>Angular</em>, to download in the app third-party JavaScript libraries</li>
  <li>How to hook to the initialization process of an <em>Angular</em> application and run our own script</li>
</ol>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  For illustration I have written a sample application that I will quote in several places in the post.
</div>
<ul>
  <li>
    The code for the example application is available at: <a href="https://github.com/agyonov/NgInitGA">https://github.com/agyonov/NgInitGA</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    The app itself is live on: <a href="https://agyonov.github.io/NgInitGA">https://agyonov.github.io/NgInitGA</a>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>
  Dynamic download of a third-party JavaScript library</h2>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  For most libraries that you would like to use, someone has already created, developed and maintains an NPM package
  with the relevant <em>Angular</em> modules and you could (and should) use them. But sometimes there is no ready NPM
  package or you do not like one that is available. Then you can directly reference the requested JavaScript library
  from your <em>Angular</em> application and use it.
</div>
<br />
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  There are two easy approaches that are described in the <em>Angular</em> documentation and, for example, in <em>Google
    Analytics</em>. And which don't always do the work for one reason or another.
</div>
<br />
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong>The first</strong>, entirely <em>Angular</em>, solution is to download the corresponding .js file from the
  Internet. Add it to your project and place a reference to the .js library in the scripts array, in the <em>angular.json</em>
  config file. E.g:
</div>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-ts">
"scripts": [
              "src/scripts/analytics.js"
           ]
</code></pre>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  As described in detail in the documentation of <em>Angular</em>, at <a href="https://angular.io/guide/workspace-config#additional-build-and-test-option">https://angular.io/guide/workspace-config#additional-build-and-test-options</a>.
</div>
<br />
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  It's OK as an approach and will work.
</div>
<br />
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong>A consideration</strong> against its possible use is that under this approach the .js script will be
  downloaded from your hosting server and not from the original server (in this case <a href="https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js">https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js</a>).
  And the question is not so much in increased traffic to your site and performance issues, but in that the author of
  the library (Google) could change things in it, have new versions, etc., and you will not have this new version until
  you re-build and do not re-publish your app.
</div>
<br />
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong>The second</strong> approach is to apply the instruction on the <em>Google Analytics</em> page <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/#alternative_async_tracking_snippe">https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/#alternative_async_tracking_snippet</a>:
</div>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-html">
&lt;script&gt;
window.ga=window.ga ||
    function(){(ga.q=ga.q||[]).push(arguments)};ga.l=+new Date;
ga('create', 'UA-XXXXX-Y', 'auto');
ga('send', 'pageview');
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script async 
    src='https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js'&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<br />
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  And the above code to be pasted directly into the <em>index.html</em> file initializing your <em>Angular</em>
  application. In particular,
  <strong>the last line</strong> of the above sample code.
</div>
<br />
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  It's OK as an approach and will also work in its <strong>part to download the .js library</strong>. In addition, here
  the objections which were valid for the first decision are irrelevant.
</div>
<br />
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong>A consideration</strong> against its possible use is stylistic â€“ not a "clean" <em>Angular</em> solution.
</div>
<br />
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  The rest of the code snip from <em>Google Analytics</em>, shown above, <strong>does not work</strong> for us at all!
  Because with <em>Angular</em> we have a Single page Application (SPA) where, unlike traditional web applications, in
  reality only the first page is loaded from the Web server and subsequently every transition from page to page, occurs
  only inside the SPA application in the browser. Also, if we have any special events (e.g. button press) they as well
  occur inside the <em>Angular</em> app and will not affect the data in <em>Google Analytics</em>.

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
</div>
<br />
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  These issues are discussed in detail in the <em>Google Analytics</em> documentation itself under the <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/single-page-applications">Single
    Page Application Tracking</a> theme.
</div>
<br />
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  Let's get back to the issue with the dynamic download of the JavaScript library. <strong>There is a third way</strong>
  that I will look at. Because the example is using <em>Google Analytics</em>, I'll expand it to be used to track
  usersâ€™ actions in the <em>Angular</em> app.
</div>
<br />
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong>NB:</strong> As for tracking of users in <em>Angular</em> application, it has great, ready-made libraries,
  such as <a href="https://github.com/angulartics/angulartics2">angulartics2</a>, which you can use. Here the question
  is not to create another such library, but with an example to show a possible solution to the two questions set at
  the beginning of this post!
</div>
<br />
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  So, the dynamic download. Let us see a sample of the following <em>Angular</em> service:
</div>
<br />
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-ts">
// Typescript extention of Window interface
declare global {
  interface Window { ga: any; }
}

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class GoogleAnaliticsService {

  // The source for the load
  private googleAnaliticsScript = {
    loaded: false,
    url: 'https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js'
  };

  constructor(@Inject(PLATFORM_ID) private platformId: Object,
    @Inject(DOCUMENT) private dom: Document) {
  }

  // Init the GA infrastructure
  public loadScript(): void {
    // Check already loaded
    if (!this.googleAnaliticsScript.loaded) {
      // Check if we are at browser
      if (isPlatformBrowser(this.platformId)) {
        // Create new scipt element
        const scriptElm: HTMLScriptElement = 
                      this.dom.createElement('script');
        scriptElm.src = this.googleAnaliticsScript.url;
        scriptElm.type = 'text/javascript';
        scriptElm.async = true;
        scriptElm.onload = () =&gt; {
          // Prevent from load second time
          this.googleAnaliticsScript.loaded = true;
        };

        // Define GA object
        window.ga = window.ga || 
            function () { 
               (window.ga.q = window.ga.q || []).push(arguments); 
            };
        window.ga.l = +new Date;

        // Set some Google Analytics stuff
        window.ga('create', environment.propertyID, 'auto');

        // Add to document
        this.dom.body.appendChild(scriptElm);
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  Basically, it's a transcription in <em>TypeScript</em>, of the instructions from the <em>Google Analytics</em> page,
  which we have above. The important points are:
</div>
<ul>
  <li>
    Just in the beginning we expand the <em>TypeScript</em> <strong>Window</strong> interface with a new field-'ga'
  </li>
  <li>
    In the <em>'loadScript'</em> method, the actual work is done:
    <ul>
      <li>
        A <em>scriptElm</em> script element is created and is added to the DOM of the Web page for download. It's the
        same as putting:
        <pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-html">
&lt;script async 
    src='https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js'&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
        in <em>index.html</em>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Defines the 'ga' field with which the <strong>Window</strong> interface is expanded, as specified by <em>Google
          Analytics</em>. It's the same as putting:
        <pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-html">
&lt;script&gt;
window.ga=window.ga ||
    function(){(ga.q=ga.q||[]).push(arguments)};
ga.l=+new Date;
ga('create', 'UA-XXXXX-Y', 'auto');
ga('send', 'pageview');
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
        in <em>index.html</em>.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  And voila!
</div>
<br />
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  ðŸ˜Š well not quite... Still, the <em>'loadScript'</em> method should be invoked, somewhere from the <em>Angular</em>
  application and cause the browser to start the download of the JavaScript library. And here we come to the second
  question:
</div>
<h2>
  Hook to the initialization of an Angular application</h2>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  But this post became a bit long. I guess it is time to finish this first part. For "hooking" to the initialization of
  the Angular application, I will write in the second part.
