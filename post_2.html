  In the first part of this post, the discussion was focused mainly around the different methods of dynamic download of
  a third-party JavaScript library in an <em>Angular</em> application. Here in this second post, we will be discussing
  the ways in which we can hook to the initialization of the <em>Angular</em> application and to fulfill our
  programming logic. For illustration I will continue to use the example application from the first part, which I will
  quote again in several places in the current post.
</div>
<ul>
  <li>
    The code for the example application is available at: <a href="https://github.com/agyonov/NgInitGA">https://github.com/agyonov/NgInitGA</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    The app itself is live on: <a href="https://agyonov.github.io/NgInitGA">https://agyonov.github.io/NgInitGA</a>
  </li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  For those who have not read the first part or have forgotten it, the example is using <em>Google Analytics</em> and
  to make the example more meaningful it is extended to allow for full tracking of users' actions in the <em>Angular</em>
  application.
</div>
<br />
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong>NB:</strong> As for tracking of users in <em>Angular</em> application, it has great, ready-made libraries,
  such as <a href="https://github.com/angulartics/angulartics2">angulartics2</a>, which you can use. Here the question
  is not to create another such library, but with an example to show a possible solution to the two questions set at
  the beginning of this post!
</div>
<h2>
  Hook to initialization of an Angular application</h2>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  I have found several methods to run your initialization program logic (your script) when launching the <em>Angular</em>
  application in the browser. I will list here two of them in short, and the third one I will look at a little more
  closely.
</div>
<h3>
  First - Use the "forRoot" static method</h3>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  If you have a service in a separate <em>Angular</em> "feature" module, then perhaps the best and most established way
  is to use a static "forRoot" method. The method is called when you import your "feature‚Äù module into the main module
  of the <em>Angular</em> application.
</div>
<br />
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  You can read in more detail at:

      forRoot() method</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>
  Second - calling your script in the <em>ngOnInit</em> method of the main AppComponent</h3>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  The most direct and not complicated method is to run the script in the <i>ngOnInit</i> method of the main <i>AppComponent</i>
  in your <em>Angular</em> application. If it works, apply it. If we use the example from the first part of the
  publication, we have completed one method-"<i>loadScript</i>". This method should be called from your initialization
  code to start the download of third-party .js <em>Google Analytics</em> Library. In the <i>app.component.ts</i> code,
  this would appear as follows:
</div>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-ts">
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.scss']
})
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {

  title = 'NgInit';

  constructor(private gas: GoogleAnaliticsService) {
  }

  ngOnInit(): void {
    // Start down load of JS Library
    this.gas.loadScript();
  }
}
</code></pre>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  Particularity, in the sample application and the use of <em>Google Analytics</em> for illustration, this technique
  will work without any problems.
</div>
<br />
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <b>A recital against</b> its possible use in other cases is that there would be situations where it would not have
  done the job ‚òπ. These are the cases where all the initializing logic <b>must have completed its execution before the
    start</b> of the method <i>ngOnInit</i> or any other code from your application.
</div>
<br />
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  An example, for such a situation, is to say when you have a<b> mandatory user authentication</b> and it must be
  completed, successful or not, before any other code from your <i>Angular </i>application is executed.
</div>
<br />
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  This user authentication scenario, in <i>Angular </i>application, is an interesting topic for which I can write a
  separate article in the future.
</div>
<h3>
  Third ‚Äì Using pre-defined in Angular tokens (the most interesting)</h3>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  There is one way to hook to the <i>Angular </i>application initialization process, about which, I believe, the
  information from the <i>Angular </i>team is shared in an overly "modest" manner. These are the so-called "Predefined
  tokens" and "Factory providers". Information about them can be found at:
</div>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://angular.io/guide/dependency-injection-providers#predefined-tokens-and-multiple-providers">https://angular.io/guide/dependency-injection-providers#predefined-tokens-and-multiple-providers</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://angular.io/guide/dependency-injection-providers#factory-providers">https://angular.io/guide/dependency-injection-providers#factory-providers</a></li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  In the example application, this approach is implemented into the <i>app.module.ts</i> file, the main module of the
  <i>Angular</i> application.
</div>
<br />
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  At the beginning we define "factory" function <b>GoogleAnaliticsServiceFactory</b> and export it! The latter is
  important from the perspective of <i>TypeScript</i> and <i>AOT</i> compiling the <i>Angular</i> application.
</div>
<br />
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  The function itself must return another, internal function. That's why it's called factory üòä.
</div>
<br />
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  The internal function that is returned by <b>GoogleAnaliticsServiceFactory</b> is your code that will be executed
  when initializing the <i>Angular</i> application. The inner function can return in result <i>void</i> or <i>Promise</i>.
</div>
<br />
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <b>Note</b>: If it returns <i>Promise</i>, the <i>Angular</i> app will be blocked until <i>Promise </i>is resolved!
</div>
<br />
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  The internal function gets as input parameter (via dependency-injection) service <b>GoogleAnaliticsService </b>and
  executes the "<i>loadScript</i>" method. That's what we were aiming for!
</div>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-ts">
// Factory provider for Angular. Provides function to be executed 
// on Angular application startup
export const GoogleAnaliticsServiceFactory = 
 (gas: GoogleAnaliticsService) =&gt; {
  return () =&gt; {
    // download
    gas.loadScript();
  };
};

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent,
    SecondPageComponent,
    HomeComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    AppRoutingModule
  ],
  providers: [
    // Provides function to be executed on Angular 
    // application startup
    {
      provide: APP_INITIALIZER,
      useFactory: GoogleAnaliticsServiceFactory,
      deps: [GoogleAnaliticsService],
      multi: true
    }
  ],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
</code></pre>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  In the <i>providers </i>array, when defining the <i>AppModule </i>main module of the <i>Angular </i>application, we
  figuratively "hook" the function defined above to the <i>Angular </i>startup process.
</div>
<br />
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  This is done by using the pre-defined token <b>APP_INITIALIZER</b>. It identifies all providers marked with it to run
  before the <i>Angular</i> application is initialized!
</div>
<br />
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <b>Note</b> that as <i>dependency </i>(the array <b>deps: [GoogleAnaliticsService]</b>) are listed the objects that
  <i>Angular </i>bootstrap process must instantiates and submit as parameters to the function that will run when the
  application starts!
</div>
<br />
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  And voila! This time for real üòä.
</div>
<h3>
  Example application</h3>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  For assurance that the above code is working, you can look at the live sample application. Try it!
</div>
<br />
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  The following code samples have also been added to the <b>GoogleAnaliticsService </b>service for accessing <i>Google
    Analitics</i>:
</div>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-ts">
  // Send page view event to Google Analytics
  public send(pageUrl: string): void {
    // Send
    window.ga('set', 'page', pageUrl);
    window.ga('send', 'pageview');
  }

  // Send event tracking event to Google Analytics
  public event(eventCategory: string, eventAction: string): void {
    // Send
    window.ga('send', 'event', eventCategory, eventAction);
  }

</code></pre>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  These methods follow the instructions of <i>Google Analytics</i> to work with SPA applications.
</div>
<br />
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  The methods are used by the <i>Home</i>, <i>Second Page</i> pages and the button <i>Just an Event</i> to send
  information to <i>Google Analytics</i> about the user's actions.
</div>
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
  <a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9D93o4sOJdI/XFGTxcrOt7I/AAAAAAAABxI/MVZuYq-Yt6Y50FuavfiS2NLOK3sqc-gxQCLcBGAs/s1600/1.png"

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  Visible from the top screen that:
</div>
<ol>
  <li>The script <i>analytics.js</i> is downloaded by the browser</li>
  <li>When transitioning from page to page and pressing the button, a post of data to the <i>collect </i>address of <i>Google
      Analytics</i>, occurs.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  In these two posts, I have tried to examine and describe in words and examples three different approaches to
  achieving the objectives of both topics:
</div>
<ul>
  <li>Download a third-party JavaScript library in <i>Angular </i>application</li>
  <li>Hook to the initialization of an <i>Angular </i>application</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  I hope that it will be helpful for you, if you need to program things like above mentioned, to choose an approach
  that best serves you.
